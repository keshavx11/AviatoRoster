# AviatoRoster

AviatoRoster has the ability to present the userâ€™s roster which holds the monthly planning of duties.

Airline crew upload their raw roster data (pdf, excel, txt, html or webcal files),
We convert this to a general format and then it is displayed in the app. 
This is then being delivered by our backend to the frontend apps in json.
